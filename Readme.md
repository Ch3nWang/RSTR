**Robust Structure-Preservation Tensorized Representation for Multi-View Unsupervised Feature Selection**
Demo codes of the work "Robust Structure-Preservation Tensorized Representation for Multi-View Unsupervised Feature Selection" 

Some tips to use this package code:
Open main.m to run RSTR. 
The default experiment uses the MSRC-v1 dataset, which is included in the package.
You can replace the dataset in the experiment as you want.
We run the demo on MATLAB R2024a on a personal computer with the AMD Ryzen 5 7500F 6-Core Processor and 32 GB RAM.
